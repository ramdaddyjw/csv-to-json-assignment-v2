# csv-to-json-assignment-v2
Version 2 of my solution for the csv-to-json assignment.

This version uses a project structure I'm more familiar with, and pushes some
of the conversion process into a utils module.  I wanted to practice doing
some of the module.exports stuff and making sure I understood scope and such
a little better before moving on.
